# Project: Food Fiesta 

## Description
"Food Fiesta" is a web application that you can use when you don't know what to cook with the ingredients you have at your disposal. Also, anyone can register and share their own recipes, and anyone can report a problem with a recipe.

## Database Structure

## Features
- Anyone, no matter if they have an account or not, can search for a recipe, by introducing a key ingredient in the searchbar, and, if needed, they can apply certain restrictions for the results (i.e. only vegan or vegetarian recipes). Plus, if they find that there is something wrong with a recipe they see, they can report that problem with just the click of a button.
- If a user decides to register for an account, they have the possibility to contribute with their own recipes, although it would have to be approved by an administrator before it will be visible in the search results.
- An adminitrator has access to all types of recipes, approved, pending or reported. Thus, they can decide whether a pending recipe should be approved or rejected, if a reported recipe should be deleted, or if it should be added back into the database. Also, an administrator can modify a recipe directly, without the recipe being reported first.
